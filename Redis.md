# Redis

Redis is used as the in-memory database between sharded actors.  
Buildfarm's backplane uses a [Jedis Cluster](https://github.com/xetorthio/jedis) for various abstractions.

## Balanced Queues
To balance CPU utilization across multiple nodes in a redis cluster, we distribute operations through redis hashtags.  We have a conceptual queue that uses multiple redis lists in its implementation.
