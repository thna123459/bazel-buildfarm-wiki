Buildfarm is a service software stack which presents an implementation of the [Remote Execution API](https://github.com/bazelbuild/remote-apis). This means it can be used by any client of that API to retain content ([[ContentAddressableStorage]]), cache ActionResults by a key ([[ActionCache]]), and execute actions asynchronously ([[Execution]]).

Buildfarm is cross-platform has been heavily tested with bazel as a client.

This documentation is a comprehensive description of the architecture, features, functionality, and operation, as well as a guide to a smoothly installing and running the software. Familiarity with the Remote Execution API is expected, and references to it will be provided as needed.
